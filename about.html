    Hey there. I just wanted to let you know a little bit about myself. This picture is of Austin,
    where I have lived for almost 20 years now. I love going to see concerts here, eating at awesome 
    restaurants, and watching college football (as well as the NFL). I also enjoy reading, watching movies,
    and playing the odd video game or two in my spare time.
